## Python Data Science Toolbox

Hi !

Since the documentation of most tools and technologies is very extensive, it often took me quite some time in data science projects to find the information I needed from documentation or stackoverflow.

This repository is therefore intended as a to-go place to quickly and easily find and apply certain code snippets or commands. If I can help anyone but myself, I'll be more than happy.
